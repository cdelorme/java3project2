***********************************************************************

Logging In:

To login, simply enter a Username, and the IP Address or Domain name of the machine running the Game Server.

If an invalid Server or Port is specified, the system will notify you within 10 seconds of a failed connection, allowing you to try again.

***********************************************************************

Using the Chat System:

For the chat system, simply enter information in the text box, and hit enter or click the accompanying send button.

To send a "Private Message" to just one user, use the format "@username" in the message box.  If no user by that name is connected, no message will be sent.

***********************************************************************

Starting a Game:

To start a game, select a User Name from the list and click "Challenge".  This will send a challenge request to another user, if they accept a game will be created.

Game instances are given a label based on the User Name of your opponent, and the game identifier.

You may initiate as many games as you want with any other connected users you want.

***********************************************************************

Memory (The Game) Instructions:

In the game of "Memory" the objective is to match tile icons of two tiles to score a point.  Matched icons are removed from the set.  Once all tiles are removed, whoever has the most points wins.

In our game, the challenger gets first turn.  To see what lies beneath each tile, click the square and a tile will be displayed.  Once a second tile is clicked, if they match you get a point, otherwise you will have 2 seconds to commit the images to memory before they are hidden again.

This particular instance of the game is based on the Super Mario Brothers 3 Nintendo game, which featured a Tile Matching game with a 3 row by 6 column display.  Unlike the Super Mario Brothers version, the tile maps are 100% randomly generated.

***********************************************************************

Server Limitations:

To keep the system within reason the system will only support up to 1000 game instances, if there are too many players with open games you may have to wait until they are freed up in order to play.
