Change Notes!


Should I have the commander & intepreter creation occur inside the user generator, since users are where the commands are issued from, and the server doesn't necessarily have to handle that?

This also means I could move the GameManager to that as well.

Or even move the interpreter loading to the Commander class.  That might make the most sense then, Commander created by UserManager, and game manager & interpreters created by the Commander.


Hmm, nope GameInterpreter will create the GameManager, my mistake.

Alright!  So far things are going well!


Excellent, I pretty much finished the skeletal layout of the Server and then some, now I am working on the matching Client system.


Client requires at least 1 argument, 2 are optional.

Arguments are Address, Port, and Debug.

Modified server to while (!ss.isClosed()) for the connection loop.



Making the system capable of hosting more than 2 players has three requirement changes to the system:

1.  ArrayList of Players in Game
2.  Enough tiles must be generated to support X many players (if we don't set a limit we have 64 tiles and 64 players, making scoring impossible)
3.  We would need a dynamic approach to challenge multiple opponents from a list box, and a command that would accept that.
